Hey, I'm Eric Ngigi, an AWS Cloud Engineer with a passion for designing and optimizing cloud infrastructure. My journey into cloud computing started in 2023, and since then, I've been dedicated to building robust, scalable solutions in the cloud.

Welcome to my corner of the web where I share insights, tutorials, and projects related to AWS, cloud architecture, and automation. You'll find a collection of technical articles that reflect my experience and some of the challenges I've overcome. 

This site is a space for me to share what I've learned and to inspire others to dive into the world of cloud engineering. There's no clutterâ€”just pure content focused on cloud technologies and best practices. I hope you find something here that sparks your interest and helps you on your own cloud journey.
